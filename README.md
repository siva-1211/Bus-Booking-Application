# Bus-Booking-Application

Here, I created an bus booking application using React. Js also includes various components like Antd, React icons, and React Bootstrap, and implements various logic with React hooks like usestate, useeffect, and usenavigate.
Can book tickets to various places , shares more data from one component to another, and has more functionality with a nice user interface.Â
